\subsection{Cryptographical Definitions}

\textbf{\textsc{DH(private key, public key)}} Curve25519 point multiplication of private key and public key, returning 32 bytes of output.\\

\textbf{\textsc{DH-Generate()} }Generates a random Curve25519 private key and derives its corresponding public key,
returning a pair of 32 bytes values, (private, public).\\

\textbf{\textsc{Aead(key, counter, plain text, auth text)}} ChaCha20Poly1305 AEAD, as specified in \href{https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7539}{RFC7539},

text being compose of  ("ScreenView-" || auth text).\\

\textbf{\textsc{Hash(input)}} BLAKE3(input), returning 32 bytes of output.\\

\textbf{\textsc{Hmac(key, input)}} Hmac-BLAKE3(key, input), the ordinary BLAKE3 hash function used in an
HMAC construction, returning 32 bytes of output.\\
